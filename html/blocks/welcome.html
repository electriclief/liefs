<span class="myheading">Liefs Layout Manager - Introduction</span>
<p>Liefs is a HTML Dynamic Layout Manager. Its purpose is to allow web designers (or the average joe) the ability to
    easly manage the layout of their webpage.</p><p>Other layout managers do exist, but they didn't serve my needs.
    &nbsp;This one does. &nbsp;Lets take a quick look at an example. &nbsp;Lets say, this page. &nbsp;This page
    consists of:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Horizontally, There is a <span style="background-color:black;color:#c6ffb2"><strong>Tree</strong></span>
        window on the left, <strong>250px in width</strong></li>
    <li>Horizontally, There is a <span style="background-color:black;color:#e0ffe1"><strong>Main</strong></span>
        window on the right, (where you are reading now) using the rest of the screen
        (<strong>100% of remaining</strong>)</li>
    <li>Vertically, There is <span style="background-color:black;color:lightgreen"><strong>Header</strong></span>
        window on top which is <strong>64px in height</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is represented in simple HTML like this.  Please <span style="color:red">(Ctrl-u)
    See the source of this page</span> to see how easy it is.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;liefs id="_master" contains="Header|_both" vertical="true"&gt;&lt;/liefs&gt;
&lt;liefs id="_both" contains="Tree|Main" start="100%"&gt;&lt;/liefs&gt;

&lt;div id="Header" start="64px"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Tree" start="200px"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Main" start="100%"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<span class="subheading">Understanding the above code:</span><br>
We have 3 Items Here:
Header (Title Window), Tree (Menu Tree window), Main (Main Content window)<br>
Items are always identified by their "start" attribute.
<br>
Header is 64px in Height<br>
Tree is 250px in Length<br>
Main is 100% of remaining Length<br>
<br>
We have a horizontal Container "_both" (Use Underscore for containers -> just my habbit)<br>
_both consists of the Tree Item(250px) , Followed by the Main Item (100%) of remaining.
It is "Horizontal" because that is the default.<br><br>
We have a vertical Container "_master"<br>
_master consists of the Header Item (64px), Followed by the _both item (100%) of remaining.
It is "Vertical" because vertical attribute was set to *anything*
